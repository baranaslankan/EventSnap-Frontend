# eventsnap-frontend

Next.js (app router) + Tailwind scaffold for EventSnap.

You already pasted your `src/` folder into the project root. This scaffold expects the app to live in `src/app` and uses TypeScript.

Quick start

```bash
cd /Users/baranaslankan/Desktop/eventsnap-frontend2/eventsnap-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes

- Environment: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_QR_BASE_URL` as needed. A `.env.local` was added with your backend URL.
- Path alias `@/*` -> `src/*` is configured in `tsconfig.json`.
- If you want me to initialize git and make an initial commit, say so and I'll run `git init` and `git add`/`git commit`.
